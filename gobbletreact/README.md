A web application of the board game Gobblet, with local and online multiplayer with rooms/room codes so it's easy to play your friends. This app uses React frontend, hosted by GH Pages, and a Express backend, hosted by Render (the backend server takes about 30 seconds to spin up, so just wait a bit for the multiplayer to load you into a room). The app uses Socket.io API to talk back and forth to the server and clients. You can play the game here at https://worley03.github.io/
